# Finance-Dashboard-UI

Overview

Finance Dashboard UI is a frontend application built to help users track and understand their financial activity through a clean and interactive interface. The project focuses on intuitive design, modular component structure, and efficient state handling using mock data.

The application demonstrates how financial data can be visualized using summary metrics, charts, and transaction-level insights, without relying on a backend.
